Depression is a mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, loss of interest, low energy, and difficulty concentrating. These feelings last for weeks or months and affect daily functioning.

Common symptoms of depression include prolonged sadness, fatigue, social withdrawal, changes in sleep or appetite, feelings of worthlessness, and loss of motivation.

Experiencing some of these symptoms does not automatically mean a person has depression. Only a qualified mental health professional can make a diagnosis.

Coping strategies for low mood and emotional distress include maintaining a daily routine, engaging in light physical activity, staying connected with trusted people, practicing relaxation techniques, and seeking professional support.

If emotional distress persists or interferes with daily life, it is recommended to consult a mental health professional such as a psychologist or psychiatrist.

In cases where someone feels overwhelmed, hopeless, or has thoughts of self-harm, immediate professional help should be sought from local mental health services or crisis helplines.
